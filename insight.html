                    <p>Total accident frequency has been decreasing over time. However, due to the covid-19 pandemic, the traffic collision decreased a lot after 2020.</p>

                    <p>The distribution of accident frequency varies widely across different areas. Some areas have a low mean, median, and mode, while others have a high mean, median, and mode. The standard deviation also varies widely across different areas, indicating that some areas have a more spread-out distribution of accident frequency than others.</p>

                    <p>The scatter plot of risk level versus accident frequency shows a weak positive correlation between the two variables. This means that as the risk level increases, the accident frequency tends to increase as well, but the relationship is not very strong.</p>
